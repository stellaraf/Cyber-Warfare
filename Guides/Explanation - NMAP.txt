🛠️ Nmap: Network Mapper
Nmap (short for Network Mapper) is a powerful and widely used open-source tool designed for network discovery and security auditing. Developed by Gordon "Fyodor" Lyon, it's a staple in the toolkit of network administrators, system engineers, penetration testers, and security professionals.

🎯 Purpose of Nmap
The primary goal of Nmap is to provide insights into network infrastructure. It allows users to:

Identify active hosts on a network.

Scan ports to determine which services are running.

Detect operating systems and their versions.

Discover potential security risks or misconfigurations.

In essence, it helps paint a picture of what’s connected to a network and how it’s configured.

⚙️ Core Functions
Nmap offers a broad range of features, including:

1. Host Discovery
Determine which devices are online. This is often done using ping sweeps or ARP requests.
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

2. Port Scanning
Check for open, closed, or filtered ports on target hosts.
nmap -p 1-65535 192.168.1.100

3. Service and Version Detection
Identify services (like HTTP, SSH) and their versions running on open ports.
nmap -sV 192.168.1.100

4. Operating System Detection
Guess the operating system based on TCP/IP fingerprinting.
nmap -O 192.168.1.100

5. Scripting Engine (NSE)
Run custom or predefined scripts to detect vulnerabilities, backdoors, misconfigurations, and more.
nmap --script=vuln 192.168.1.100

6. Traceroute
Map the path packets take to reach a host.
nmap --traceroute 192.168.1.100

🔍 Popular Use Cases
✅ 1. Network Inventory
Admins use Nmap to audit what devices are live, what services are offered, and ensure there’s no rogue hardware.

✅ 2. Security Auditing
Penetration testers and red teams scan networks for vulnerable systems and services.

✅ 3. Vulnerability Scanning
Combined with NSE scripts, Nmap helps identify CVEs, outdated software, weak SSL configurations, etc.

✅ 4. Compliance Testing
Used as part of periodic scans to maintain standards like PCI-DSS, HIPAA, or ISO 27001.

✅ 5. Firewall Testing
Nmap can test how well firewalls and intrusion detection systems detect or block traffic.

✅ 6. Pre-Exploit Recon
Before launching attacks during a red team operation or CTF, users rely on Nmap to gather intelligence.

🧪 Sample Command for Full Recon
bash
Copy
Edit
nmap -A -T4 -p- 192.168.1.100
Breakdown:

-A: Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

-T4: Speeds up the scan (higher aggressiveness).

-p-: Scans all 65535 ports.

🧠 Pro Tips
Run as root/admin for accurate results (especially for OS detection).

Combine with Zenmap (GUI version) for visualization.

Regularly update with nmap --script-updatedb for the latest scripts.

🛡️ Important Note
While Nmap is powerful, use it responsibly. Unauthorized scanning of networks can be considered illegal or unethical. Always have permission before running scans, especially against systems you don’t own.
